This article concurred with my previous opinion on the importance of user experience research. I have taken the class Ideation and Prototyping here at IDM, which is a class that taught prototping in reference to user research. At every new development to a project, we were ushered to user test immediately before making the decision to include a new feature. Even in the very beginning of a project, one can easily and quickly design a paper prototype of a design to see if a layout makes sense. Or even test a user's reaction to an idea using card sorting or something of the like. It seems tedious and annoying to constantly be stopping your work to test at first, but in the long run it equates to a much more intelligent product. And you didn't waste time perfecting a feature that no one will use, or that no one understands. Especially in the real world (where you actually have a client to please), user experience testing is a crucial component of the design process.
