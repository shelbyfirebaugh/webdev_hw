		<h3><a href="#">World of Blues</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p id="story">When I came into World of Blues in the late afternoon I'd go straight to the back room and fill up a big bucket with almost equal parts Murphy Oil Soap and water and bring it out to the bar. The chairs and tables were scrambled wherever they'd been left the night before and it was my job to line up the tables and turn the chairs so they [...]</p>

		<h3><a href="#">Hopey</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p>No one thought it was a good idea for me to get a puppy, not even me, really. I'd even named the dog Hopey, as if freighting this tiny animal with a huge and obvious symbolic meaning would guarantee her a place in my heart. Instead it was like the time Joseph got me a potted marantha for Valentine's Day and I joked that it was "the [...]</p>

		<h3><a href="#">Going Dutch</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p>After I moved out of the Greenpoint apartment where Joseph and I had lived for four years and my monthlong sublet in the Beast House ended, I moved, alone, into a yearlong sublet in a rent-stabilized building on the southernmost edge of downtown Brooklyn.<br/>The other tenants were all so old [...]</p>

		<h3><a href="#">And the Heart Says</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p>We had a long conversation before we left about whether we would bring any pot with us to the Bethany Beach condo my parents were letting us stay in for a week. I had voted at first for not bringing any, but then I'd changed my mind and decided we should just bring a little bit. Just a little bit, and probably we wouldn't even smoke [...]</p>

		<h3><a href="#">The Lens</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p>I had been fine for a year, more than a year, and then at Vicki's wedding reception a dark familiar thing stood near me, breathing hard, and I was standing half in the sun and half in its shadow, not sure whether I'd be able to fight it off. Maybe this thought only occurred to me because the wedding reception was being held in an [...]</p>

		<h3><a href="#">Claudine</a></h3>
		<h4>by Emily Gould</h4>
		<p>On a warm night in May I went out to do karaoke at a tiny bar downtown. Because it was a weeknight I left early, just past midnight. It was too early and too nice out to justify taking a cab. A limo sprouting bachelorettes from its roof passed me, trailing squeals that echoed in the traffickless late-night street, and when they paused at a [...]</p>
